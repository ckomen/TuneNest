## API Integration

GroovePlay integrates with a music API (e.g., [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/) or [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)). Ensure you have an API key to enable functionality.

### Example API Endpoint

- **Search for Tracks**:
  ```
  GET /search?q=<query>
  ```
  Response:
  ```json
  {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "3135556",
        "title": "Shape of You",
        "artist": { "name": "Ed Sheeran" },
        "album": { "title": "Divide", "cover": "https://linktoalbumcover.jpg" },
        "preview": "https://linktoaudio.mp3"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the application layout.
- **style.css**: Contains styles for the application UI.
- **script.js**: Manages DOM manipulation, event handling, and API interactions.

## How It Works

1. **Search and Fetch**:
   - Users input a search term, and the app fetches matching songs from the external API.

2. **Song Playback**:
   - Handles audio playback using the HTML5 `<audio>` element.

3. **Playlist Management**:
   - Adds songs to a playlist by storing data in the browserâ€™s local storage.

4. **Dynamic UI Updates**:
   - Updates the DOM dynamically to reflect user actions like adding songs or switching tracks.

---

## Possible Enhancements

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Integrate with a third-party API for user accounts to save playlists across devices.

2. **Offline Mode**:
   - Allow users to download tracks for offline playback.

3. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Provide translations for a global audience.
